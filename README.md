Wunderdashboard
===============
Obviously, a Wunderlist dashboard

This is a really simple dashboard which pulls your open tasks from Wunderlist and displays them in a grid, where rows represent lists and columns represent the next 7 days. Try it at http://wunderdashboard.julian-krenge.de

It builds upon and Joshua de Gier's Wunderlist2-PHP-Wrapper (https://github.com/PENDOnl/Wunderlist2-PHP-Wrapper) Twitter Bootstrap (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
